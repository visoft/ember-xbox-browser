# Xbox-Browser

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

This is a quick little demo of using Ember 2.0 and Ember Data with the (unofficial) XBoxAPI.

To get it to work, you'll need an API key from [XBoxAPI](https://xboxapi.com).

Once you have that, add an entry to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file with your key like so:

    export XBOX_API_KEY=<Your API Key>

The app should pick this up automatically when you run it providing you have Node.js installed.
